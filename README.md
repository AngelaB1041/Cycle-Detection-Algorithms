# Cycle-Detection-Algorithms
Project 4 for CS 3353-Algorithms

This repository has three approaches to solving this problem from leetcode: 

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Only Floyd's Algorithm solves it within these parameters:

1. You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2. You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

The other two are naive approaches that solve the problem, but not with the restrictions. Both Floyd's Algorithm and the Hash Table approach can be applied to other areas of cycle detection, such as finding a cycle in a linked list.
