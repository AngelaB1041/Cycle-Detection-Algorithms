# Cycle-Detection-Algorithms
Project 4 for CS 3353-Algorithms

This repository contains two different implementations for detecting a cycle in a singly linked list. One implementation is a trivial implementation, the other is Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm. The trivial solution has a greater time complexity than Floyd's algorithm. The main driver code will show that Floyd's is faster than the trivial solution.
